# Portfolio
My portfolio for Python Class of 2021
This is the my final projects that I like best to put into my portfolio. 
This portfolio once filled will show my growth as a programer and a student. 
Inside of each term you will find another readme and the code. 
It will tell you what to do with the program and what should happen.
I hope you have fun with my code that I have and I'm looking forward to the future.
