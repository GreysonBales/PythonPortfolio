This is just a simple alarm clock.
It shows hours, minutes, and seconds.
The alarm clock does have an alarm setting to it.
If you click 'a' then in the python window it will ask for your imput of a time.
When the clock reaches that time, the alarm will go off.
Simple way to get out,
use the keybind 'x'



This code was made in class one day as a fun activity since it was a short day and we needed something to do.
It was also the first time working inside a GUI.
For the most part the code is self explained, so if you wish to switch colors on anything, you should be able to find it.
