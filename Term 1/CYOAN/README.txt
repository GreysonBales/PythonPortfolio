You will need all three programs downloaded for this.
With all three on the computer all you will need to do is run the 'revisedbook'program.
It will start on page one and then it will continue on untill you either hit and end, or exit the program.
We did this project as a group and it was a silly long drawn out method of doing it.
Hopefully this book is a fun read and everything works out the way it is supposed to.
Just remeber is does use imports from the other files.
