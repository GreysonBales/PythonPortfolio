This code was meant to become a sort of game.
You're given a random chest with random items.
That would then give you increased stats, and that's about it.
If the chest had to many items in it, then you would be prompted to throw some out.
Sadly, not every item in the game has a purpose yet.

Hopefully this game will come a little further in the future.
