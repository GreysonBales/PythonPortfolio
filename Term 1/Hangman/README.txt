Hangman is exactly like the one we played as kids. 
You get a random word and you need to guess that word.
In the program you can see where the words are, you can change the words to whater you want.
all you need to do is "word","word" (remember quatations and commas)
The flow map was created to help make this hangman a little easier if you wanted to look at that to see how we
got to where to got.
