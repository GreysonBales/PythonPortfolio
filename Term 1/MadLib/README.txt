The mad lib will ask for certain parts of speach and you will need to fill them in.
It will then put them in the same spots as they are missing in the story.
You made the story what you wanted with your inputs.
It is just the bee script though...
Be careful as you can input anything you want, it won't check the
credibilty of the input.
